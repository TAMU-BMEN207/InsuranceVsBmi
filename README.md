# InsuranceVsBmi
In this example, we take a look at a dataset that includes insurance charges, bmi, and smoking status. We first separate them into smokers and non smokers and try to predict insurance charges based on their BMI by fitting a line to the data and minimizing the least squared error using gradient descent.
